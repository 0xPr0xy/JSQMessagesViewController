# Fork of [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController) [Depricated] to include support for (iphone x) safe area


## Changelog

- updated JSQMessagesViewController to make sure the collectionView respects safeAreaLayoutGuide
- updated JSQMessagesInputToolbar to make sure the toolbar respects safeAreaLayoutGuide
- added a backgroundView to JSQMessagesViewController, so the toolbar had a background that does not respect safeAreaLayoutGuide
